Hi, I’m @EloMathies and I am currently a Clinical Research Assistant working with Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS), a form of non-invasive brain stimulation! 
Currently I am interested in Technical Writing, User Experience, and in general becoming a more competent coder. I am open and interested in collaborations on OpenSource Technical Writing Documentation and UX/UI Projects. 

I can easily be contacted by email at elonmath96@gmail.com
